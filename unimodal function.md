A function $f(x)$ is unimodal if:
- The domain of $f$ is a convex set
- $\exists x^* \in dom(f)$ such that $f(x^*)\leq f(x),\hspace{1em} \forall x\in dom(f)$
- For all $x_0\in dom(f)$ there is a trajectory $x(\lambda)\in dom(f)$ with $x(0)=x_0$ and $x(1) = x^*$ such that: $f(x(\lambda))\leq f(x_0), \forall \lambda \in [0,1]$
